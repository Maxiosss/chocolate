          Milk chocolate is a solid chocolate confectionery containing cocoa,
          sugar and milk. It is the most consumed type of chocolate. Chocolate
          was originally sold and consumed as a beverage in pre-Columbian times.
          Although four-fifths of all milk chocolate is sold in the United
          States and Europe, increasingly large amounts are consumed in China
          and Latin America.
